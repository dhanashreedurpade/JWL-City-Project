# JWL-City-Project
Project Title: JWL City Design Trend Analysis

Short Description:
Performed clustering on city design and architecture data to identify emerging trends. Created a dashboard for design trend analysis to support urban planning and development insights.

Tech Stack:
Python (Scikit-learn for clustering, Pandas)
Power BI (Dashboard & Trend Visualization)
SQL (Data preparation & analysis)

Features and Highlight:
Applied clustering algorithms to group design patterns and city features.
Developed a trend analysis dashboard for comparing urban design choices.
Provided data-driven insights for better planning and decision-making.

Business Impact:
Supported urban planners and architects in recognizing emerging design and infrastructure trends.
Facilitated better resource allocation by clustering similar city development patterns.
Enabled data-backed policy decisions through trend visualization and comparative analysis.
